<h1 id="reproducing-the-results-from-the-paper">Reproducing the results
from the paper</h1>
<p>This list contains instructions to reproduce all experiments conduced
in the paper. It assumes that you have installed the tool. Otherwise,
see the instructions at <a href="../readme.html">../readme.html</a>.</p>
<h2 id="general-notes">General notes</h2>
<p>Navigate to the root directory of the tool so that the binary is
located at <code>target/release/bw-responsibility</code>.</p>
<p>You can perform all experiments either with <a
href="https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/">PRISM</a> or without it. PRISM
is only used to preprocess the transition system and generate the
counterexample. If you do not have PRISM installed, append
<code>--no-prism</code> to every command you execute. The tool will then
use pre-processed transition systems and manually specified
counterexamples instead. The results will be the same in either
case.</p>
<h2 id="reproducibility-and-randomness">Reproducibility and
randomness</h2>
<p>Several benchmarks use a stochastic algorithm. In these cases, the
tool is usually run for t seconds and as many samples as possible are
performed. You can run the same benchmarks, but due to different
hardware and different random seeds, the results might be different.</p>
<p>Therefore, we also provide a reproducible version of each benchmark.
This contains a fixed seed and the number of samples that our machine
was able to perform in the given time. The result should thus also match
our results exactly. However, the runtime may differ and not match the
runtime given in the paper.</p>
<p>We have also only performed limited testing on other hardware. It is
possible that the randomness is not reproduced exactly if other
platforms provide different implementations of randomness.</p>
