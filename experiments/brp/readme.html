<p>You can reproduce the results from the “Example: BRP” in the “State
grouping” subsection of the implementation as follows.</p>
<p>To check that the stochastic algorithm does not produce significant
results even after running for 60s, run</p>
<pre><code>./target/release/bw-responsibility --benchmark experiments/brp/benchmark_individual_reproducible -j8</code></pre>
<p>This will take tens of minutes, depending on your machine. After
that, you should be able to see that the standard deviation for 60s is
in parentheses, indicating a non-significant result.</p>
<p>To compare this with the grouped case, run</p>
<pre><code>./target/release/bw-responsibility --benchmark experiments/brp/benchmark_grouped_reproducible -j8</code></pre>
<p>This should not take as long. You should see a standard deviation of
0.0006 for t=1s.</p>
